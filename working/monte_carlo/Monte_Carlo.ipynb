    "We saw that generating random numbers following different distributions could be easily done with the Von Neumann rejection method. Although, to be efficient, the choice of the distribution used needs to be done in order to minimizes rejected data. If the distribution is invertible, the invertion method is very easy to implement and efficient but, the inverse function might be hard to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "The random walk method is a very efficient way to model the diffusion process. It can also model stochastic event such as stock prices. As soon as the complexity of the model for a small displacement increases, finding the analytical solution become almost impossible. This is why it is very usefull to compute those processes with numerical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was also interesting to see the preidction power of a relatively simple model that is the Ising model. The phase transition is remarkably well predicted with an initial magetized state, but not at all with a random initial state. this might be due to a grid size not sufficiently big. This algorithm could be computed for a way larger grid and with a bigger number of iteration but it has not been done because the computation was far too long."
